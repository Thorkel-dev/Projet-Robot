## Preamble :black_nib:

The objective of the project is to develop an interface to control a robot in a simulator. The project is divided into versions allowing to practice several notions of the C language.

## Launching :rocket:

To launch the application, you just have to execute the command `java -jar intox-java_1.8-v0.3.6.jar` at the root of the project.
An interface is launched. This is the robot simulator.

To control the robot running in a terminal the binary, in `monRobot/bin` after running the make command in `monRobot/` :
- `robot_pc` for version 1 and 1.5
- `telco` (client) and `commado` (server) for version 2 and higher 

Now you can control the robot.

## Limits :warning:
